# PluginInstaller
PluginInstaller is a plugin designed for eaglercraft that can install plugins from an [online repository](https://github.com/darverdevs/PluginInstallerRepo) to your server just with a /install <plugin> command.
This plugin also has an autoupdater so theres no need to constantly redownload the plugin.
### **The download link is ---> [here](https://github.com/darverdevs/PluginInstaller/raw/main/out/artifacts/PluginInstaller_jar/PluginInstaller.jar)** <---
## How to install:
Download the jar file from the link above
Drag and drop it into your plugins folder in java -> bukkit_command -> plugins (If you are using replit)
  
restart your server
  
Done!
## How to use:
This plugin as stated before, has an auto-updater so you do not need to manually update it.
### Commands:
`/plist` or `plist` in console: First command you should run after installing the plugin. It gives you a list of the current avaliable plugins that can be installed
  
`/install <plugin>` or `install <plugin>` in console: After you have taken a look at the plugins list with the command above, run this command replacing <plugin> with the name of the plugin you want to install (non case-sensitive).
  
`/install recommended` or `install recommended` in console: Installs plugins that are recommended for every server
#### Coming soon:
- `/repo`: lets you add your own repository of plugins
- A "front page" list of plugins that shows a list of the most commonly installed plugins and suggests plugins for you to intall based on the plugins you have

## How to contribute:
Since PluginInstaller runs on an autoupdater, all contributions must be made from pull requests either by forks or branches approved by someone in the darverdevs group and tested before a pull request is made
