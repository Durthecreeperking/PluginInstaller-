# PluginInstaller
PluginInstaller is a plugin designed for eaglercraft that can install plugins from an [online repository](https://github.com/darverdevs/PluginInstallerRepo) to your server just with a /install <plugin> command.
This plugin also has an autoupdater so theres no need to constantly redownload the plugin.

## How to contribute:
Since PluginInstaller runs on an autoupdater, all contributions must be made from pull requests either by forks or branches approved by someone in the darverdevs group and tested before a pull request is made
